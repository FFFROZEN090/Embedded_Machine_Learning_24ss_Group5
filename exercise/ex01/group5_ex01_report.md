## 1.1 Reading

This paper introduces an open-source benchmark suite for ultra-low-power tiny machine learning systems. The key contribution is that it is the first readily reproducible industry-standard benchmark suite in this field. 

The MLPerf Tiny framework is a flexible and modular system that accommodates the needs of both hardware and software users. It includes extensive reference implementations that function as standards for the open-source community. Furthermore, this paper discusses about four benchmarks in the suite: Visual Wake Words,  Image Classification, Keyword Spotting, Anomaly Detection, targeting various usecases. 

I fully accept this paper because a standard for performance measurement is essential to keep up with the rapid expansion in the IoT hardware and software industry. Additionally, by the time of this paper's publication, the benchmark presented has already been adopted by the TinyML research community as a standard test set, demonstrating the significant impact of this benchmark.
